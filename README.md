**LIGHT INTENSITY REGULATOR USING DIAC TRIAC.**

**_Working principle of Light dimmers_**

> Modern light dimmers work by changing the duty cycle of the AC voltage which is applied to the lights being controlled. 

>For instance, if the voltage is applied to half of the AC cycle, then the light bulb will appear with less intensity when it gets the full AC voltage it will appear with high intensity Because it gets the low power to heat the filament. 

>These light dimmers use the brightness knob to control at what point each cycle to switch the light ON and OFF.

**_Components Required_**
> DIAC 
> TRIAC

**_DIAC_**

> The DIAC (diode for alternating current) is a diode that conducts electrical current only after its breakover voltage, VBO, has been reached momentarily.
> DIACs are also called "symmetrical trigger diodes" due to the symmetry of their characteristic curve. Because DIACs are bidirectional devices, their terminals are not labelled as anode and cathode but as A1 and A2 or main terminal MT1 and MT2.
> DIACs have no gate electrode, unlike some other thyristors that they are commonly used to trigger, such as TRIACs.

**_TRIAC_**
> A TRIAC (triode for alternating current) ; also bidirectional triode thyristor or bilateral triode thyristor) is a three terminal electronic component that conducts current in either direction when triggered.
> The bidirectionality of TRIACs makes them convenient switches for alternating current (AC). 
> TRIACs differ from SCRs in that they allow current flow in both directions, whereas an SCR can only conduct current in a single direction. 
> Most TRIACs can be triggered by applying either a positive or negative voltage to the gate (an SCR requires a positive voltage). 
> Once triggered, SCRs and TRIACs continue to conduct, even if the gate current ceases, until the main current drops below a certain level called the holding current.

**_Use of diac , triac in dimmer_**
> The DIAC is a full-wave or bi-directional semiconductor switch that can be turned on in both forward and reverse polarities. The DIAC gains its name from the contraction of the words Diode Alternating Current. • The DIAC is widely used to assist even triggering of a TRIAC when used in AC switches. DIACs are mainly used in dimmer applications and also in starter circuits for florescent lamps.

> The TRIAC is a three terminal semiconductor device for controlling current. It gains its name from the term Triode for Alternating Current.  It is effectively a development of the SCR or thyristor, but unlike the thyristor which is only able to conduct in one direction, the TRIAC is a bidirectional device. • The TRIAC is an ideal device to use for AC switching applications because it can control the current flow over both halves of an alternating cycle.

**_Application_**

> The issue here is that we need to use some rooms for many different purposes, and these different functions call for varying amounts of light. This is when the light dimmer switch comes into place; a handy electrical component that lets you adjust light levels from nearly dark to fully lit by simply turning a knob or sliding a lever.
> An effective way to quickly change the mood of a room is by dimming or brightening the lights with a dimmer switch. A softer light results in a more comforting, relaxing atmosphere. Brighter lighting is more suitable for normal room use and reading.
> An easy way to control your lighting is to install a dimmer switch. Dimmer switches come in four popular styles: dial; slide; touch pad and combination light switch/dimmer slide. Light dimmer switches come in different shapes and each operates a little differently.
